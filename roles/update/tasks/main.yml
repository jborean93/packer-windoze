# This is a pretty ugly hack as there is no do until over a block of tasks. This
# will loop over the update and reboot task 10 times to cover all updates, the
# tasks in the loop are skipped when there are no updates which leads to a very
# minimal loss of time when all the updates are installed and we are still
# looping.
# We also set a dict that contains each category we loop through and whether we
# have exhausted the updates for the respective category. This is only done
# win_updates sometimes fails when too many updates need to be installed. This
# way each update block is split into smaller chunks.
